			<h1>Military</h1><br>
			<img src="images/military.jpg">
			<p>Military technology is the collection of equipment, vehicles, structures and communication systems that are designed for use in warfare. It comprises the kinds of technology that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in application

		<h1>Future Weapons</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><image src ="images/rm.jpg"><br><br><br>
				<h2>Robot Mules</h2>
				<p>An amazingly agile "pack mule" robot will one day be commonplace on military missions in the field. The robot will carry gear, such as heavy backpacks that can slow down ground forces.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/mw.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Meshworm</h2>
				<p> The Meshworm -about the size of a fingertip- can move silently into the tiniest places to report back data, such as temperatures inside a confined space. It can also record audio and maybe even video in future versions.</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/rg.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Microwave Ray Gun</h2>			
				<p>This weapon is designed to inject blasts of sound directly into a person's head from a couple of hundred yards away. Microwaves enter the head directly through the skull, not the ear, so protective earplugs are useless.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/lft.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Live Fire Trainers</h2>
				<p> They can move in a lifelike manner with unpredictable turns, stops and sprints, as would a real live target. Lifelike hardened plastic dummies on the Segways can be made up to look like enemies in uniform, terrorists or assassins.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/sbl.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Space-Based Laser</h2>			
				<p> Existing agreements could someday expire and a space laser deployment would be seen as necessary if any other country moves toward deploying its own. As envisioned by scientists, a space-based laser could send a powerful destructive beam at, say, an enemy's ballistic missile site a few thousand miles away.
				</p></li>
			<li>
			<image src ="images/rock.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots</h2>
				<p>PAL Robotics in Barcelona, Spain, is developing advanced bipedal robots that can recognize people, enter buildings, avoid obstacles and pick up objects in their "hands." They also have voice recognition systems that can take verbal commands.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/suit.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Robotic Suit</h2>			
				<p>This robot, surprisingly agile and eerily anthropomorphic, is able to simulate the stress that soldiers put on their protective clothing, helping biohazard and other battle-wear makers refine their designs. Petman, also designed by Boston Dynamics, can walk, crawl and do calisthenics while wearing test suits and being exposed to chemical warfare agents in secure lab settings.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/fly.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Flybot</h2>
				<p>This tiny robotic fly will be sent on reconnaissance missions in areas too dangerous for soldiers, including places contaminated by chemical or biological weapons. It weighs less than a pin and can be remotely controlled in flight.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/drone.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Super Drone</h2>			
				<p> Now imagine an unmanned ultra-high speed aerial surveillance drone that can reach speeds of 4,000 miles-per-hour and fly at altitudes of up to 100,000 feet with intercontinental range. Such a plane is currently in development at Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman under a classified contract from the Pentagon.

		<h1>Today's Weapons</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><image src ="images/drn.jpg"><br><br><br>
				<h2>Drones</h2>
				<p>Combat drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, enable troops to deploy weapons in war while safely remaining thousands of miles away from the front lines of the battlefield. As such, the lives of drone pilots are not in danger, which helps the military limit the number of combat fatalities.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/fbw.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Fly-by-wire</h2>
				
				<p>Fly-by-wire technology replaces manual flight controls with an electronic interface that uses signals generated by a computer and transmitted by wires to move control mechanisms. The introduction of fly-by-wire systems in aircraft enabled more precise computer guidance and control.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/sub.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Submarines</h2>
				
				<p>Submarines revolutionized naval warfare by introducing underwater vessels capable of attacking enemy ships.Today, the military uses submarines to carry missiles, conduct reconnaissance, support land attacks, and establish blockades.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/tmis.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Tomahawk Missiles</h2>
				
				<p>The Tomahawk is a type of long-range cruise missile designed to fly at extremely low altitudes at subsonic speeds, enabling the weapons to be used to attack various surface targets. These jet engine-powered missiles were first used operationally during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/plane.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Stealth Aircraft</h2>
				
				<p> While planes cannot be completely invisible to radar detection, stealth planes use a range of advanced technologies to reduce the aircraft's reflection, radio frequency spectrum, and radar and infrared emissions. 
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/space.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Space Weapons</h2>
				
				<p>Space weapons include a range of warheads that can attack targets on Earth from space, intercept and disable missiles traveling through space, or destroy space systems or satellites in orbit. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union both developed space weapons, as political tensions escalated.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/nuke.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Nuclear Weapon</h2>
				
				<p>Nuclear bombs are humankind's most destructive weapons. These warheads draw their destructive force from nuclear reactions, which release enormous amounts of explosive energy.
				</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Medieval Weapons</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><image src ="images/caltrop.jpg"><br><br><br>
				<h2>Caltrop</h2>
				
				<p>Caltrops serve to slow down the advance of horses, war elephants, and human troops. It was said to be particularly effective against the soft feet of camels.In modern times Caltrops have been used at times during labor strikes and other disputes.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/oil.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Boiling Oil</h2>
				<p>Castles were often built with special holes in the sides to make it easier to pour this blistering liquid on unsuspecting climbers. They were so effective that they were called murder-holes.
				</p></li>
				
			<li><image src ="images/arb.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Arbalest</h2>
				
				<p>Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) strength and be accurate up to 500m.
