	<h1>3D Printing</h1><br>
	<ul>
		<li><h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>Generation of graspable three-dimensional objects applied for surgical planning, prosthetics and related applications using 3D printing or rapid prototyping is summarized and evaluated.</p></li>
		<li><h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
	<p>Graspable 3D objects overcome the limitations of 3D visualizations which can only be displayed on flat screens. 3D objects can be produced based on CT or MRI volumetric medical images.</p></li>
		<li><h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Patient–clinician interaction, surgical training, medical research and education may require graspable 3D objects. The limitations of rapid prototyping include cost and complexity, as well as the need for specialized equipment and consumables such as photoresist resins.</p></li>
		<li><h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>Medical application of rapid prototyping is feasible for specialized surgical planning and prosthetics applications and has significant potential for development of new medical applications.</p></li>

		<h1>Connected Health</h1><br>
			<p>With the explosion of wearable technology and legislation like the Affordable Care Act, the medical product industry is rapidly evolving. Healthcare is seeing unprecedented changes, creating new opportunities for devices that connect consumers and doctors to information faster, easier, and more efficiently.

		<h1>CT Scan</h1><br>	
		<p>Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is also known as "CAT scanning" (Computed Axial Tomography). Tomography is from the Greek word "tomos" meaning "slice" or "section" and "graphia" meaning "describing".</p>

		<h1>Scariest Medical Tools</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><image src ="images/ost.jpg">
			<br><br><br>
				<h2>Osteotome</h2>
				<p>While technically a type of chain saw, this medical instrument, invented byBernard Heine around 1830, wasn’t used to cut down trees. The sharp spike was driven into the patient’s skull to hold the instrument in place, then the doctor cranked the handle to turn the saw-toothed blade. 
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/divul.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Stricture Divulsor</h2>
				<p>When a male patient's urethra became too narrow to permit proper urine flow, doctors used a stricture divulsor. Basically, the instrument was inserted into the urethra via the tip of the penis and navigated to the required place.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/phan.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Dental Phantom</h2>
				<p>Judging from the design, this aluminum model was probably covered by a rubber head, now lost. Older versions were simpler, lacking the "silently screaming soul damned to an eternity in Hell" quality of later pieces. Dental phantoms often used human teeth extracted from corpses, and modern dental students still use similar models.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/force.png"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Hemorrhoid Forceps</h2>
				<p> This instrument worked by tightly grasping and crushing an external hemorrhoid to restrict the blood supply. The damaged tissue would eventually die and wither off. Internal hemorrhoids were first coaxed out using hooks (enticing, right?) and cauterized or snipped off with scissors.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/litho.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Lithotome Caché</h2>
			
				<p>The instrument contained two adjustable hidden blades that would spring out and cut and dilate the neck of the bladder (hopefully in a controlled way). The surgeon would then begin probing with forceps for the calculus felt earlier through the wall of the rectum, such operations took around five minutes or so.</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/ecra.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Écraseur</h2>
			
				<p>For the removal of hemorrhoids and other growths, tumors, polyps, and cysts in the esophagus, larynx, uterus, or ovaries, an écraseur (French for “crusher”) was the instrument of choice. The loop on the end of the instrument could be a saw-toothed chain or a simple wire and was employed to strangle and crush the growth, preventing hemorrhage by restricting blood supply like a tourniquet. After lassoing the base of the growth, the doctor turned a screw to apply pressure. Variations of the écraseur continued torefine the design. Similar instruments were used in veterinary medicine tocastrate cattle.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/dent.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Dental Key</h2>
			
				<p> The dental key allowed the doctor to clamp the patient’s tooth with the claw at the end of the instrument. By rocking or rotating the key, the tooth was levered out of the gum, roots and all—without anesthetic.
				</p></li>
			<li><image src ="images/fetal.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				<h2>Fetal Destructor and Extractor</h2>
			
				<p> If the doctor determined the fetus was already dead, he would use an instrument to decapitate the corpse in situ, then extract the body by means of a hook or crochet. If the fetus was alive, a perforator delivered a killing blow before extraction. This was considered an act of compassion.
